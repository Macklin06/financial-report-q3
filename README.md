- `chart.png` - Generated boxplot visualization (512x512 pixels)

## Visualization Details

The boxplot shows the distribution of purchase amounts across four customer segments:
- **Premium**: High-value customers with larger average purchases
- **Standard**: Regular customers with moderate spending
- **Basic**: Entry-level customers with lower spending
- **Occasional**: Infrequent buyers with variable spending patterns

## Technical Specifications

- **Chart Type:** Boxplot
- **Library:** Seaborn with Matplotlib
- **Output Format:** PNG (512x512 pixels)
- **Data:** Synthetic customer purchase data

## Usage

To regenerate the visualization:

```bash
python chart.py
```

This will create a new `chart.png` file with the boxplot visualization.

```
seaborn>=0.12.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
pandas>=1.3.0
